:tophat: A Chrome extension for use while playing online poker.

## Why?
The [pot odds](http://www.universidadedopoker.com/artigos-de-poker/calculando-o-pot-odds/) is a very important calculation to be done by those who wants to earn some money with poker. 
For beginners, is not so easy to do it quickly while playing a online game. It helps you to know if you should call or fold.

## How it works?
It's a simple Chrome Extension for use while playing your poker game.
After a move (flop, turn or river) you just:

1. Fill the field **TO CALL** with the total value you need to call to play.
2. Fill the field **POT** with the total pot value, including other players bets.
3. Fill the field **OUTS** with your outs :) 

  If you don't know what it means, *outs* are the quantity of cards that would make your hand, a **very nice** hand. 
  
  You can read more about pot outs [here](https://www.intelipoker.com/articles/Calculando-Odds).
  
------

If the **% needed** calculed be grather than the **% odds** it's recomended that you FOLD.

If the **% needed** calculed be less than the **% odds** it's recomended that you CALL.

## Install
It's a Chrome extension, so you can just install it by searching "Poker Oddy" at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/).
